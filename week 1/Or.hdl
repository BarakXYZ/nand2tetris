/*
Not like 'And', 'Or' is is different than 'Nand' only where:
0,0 (Nand 1, Or 0), and at 1,1 (Nand 0, Or 1).
We can negate both inputs to change the behavior of Nand only in 0,0 and 1,1
to output Or.
The middle (0,1 1,0) won't change by the negation since they'll still stay opposite.

And
0 0 = 0
0 1 = 0
1 0 = 0
1 1 = 1

Or
0 0 = 0
0 1 = 1
1 0 = 1
1 1 = 1

Nand
0 0 = 1
0 1 = 1
1 0 = 1
1 1 = 0
