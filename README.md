# Build and Submission Guidelines

## Language Configuration

- **Important**: In the language configuration file, only mention "debug" - do NOT mention C++
- This has caused significant issues in the past

## Compression Requirements

- Use only regular Windows/MacOS native zipping options
- When creating the zip file, compress only the **content** of the folder, not the folder itself
- When the zip is opened, files should be immediately visible (no nested folder structure)

## Build System

- Add a Makefile to the project
- Reference examples from Project 7 & 8 for implementation guidance
