Make sure in the lang file to not mention C++, only debug!!!
This has caused a lot of problems.

Also only zip
via regular Windows native zipping options.

Add a MakeFile see examples from project 7 & 8

When zipping, zip only the content of the folder, not the folder itself. So when opening the zip, you should have files immediately.
