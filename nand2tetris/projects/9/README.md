# The Legend of the Hack Assembly: The Way of NAND

## Description
The Legend of the Hack Assembly is a collection of increasingly demanding Assembly code challenges. Solve all queries, jump between different memory cells, and figure out the final answers.

## Features
- **Answer and Comment Buffers**: Store your solutions and program flow. Buffers retain their values while jumping to different addresses.
- **Lookup Utility**: Visit different addresses, their content, and challenges. Navigate dynamically and enjoy fun interactions with various NPCs (Memory Cells).
- **Interactive UI**: Engage with Shimon which will guide your through the challenges, and visit other cute and bizarre creatures using a fun interactive UI and mechanics.
- **Challenging Tasks**: Test your Assembly capabilities with demanding challenges!

## Usage
1. This project works only with the offline non-web-IDE version of the VMEmulator. It was tested on both macOS and Windows and works well on both versions. The Web-IDE handles the Sys.wait() function differently, and also input in general seems to behave differently. And so I chose the offline version for convenience.
2. Open the VMEmulator from the Tools folder (found in the NAND2TETRIS files) and load the VM folder containing the compiled Jack code.
3. Set the "Animate" box to "No Animation."
4. Run the game.
4. Full instruction and how-to can be found in the game itself, but here's a quick primer:
- Enter [C]hallenge Mode with the 'C' key to type in your answers.
- Use [L]ookup Mode to search for different addresses.
- Resolve other addresses to complete the main challenges.

## Known Bugs
- The Web-IDE version of the VM Emulator cannot run this game since it handles input and time in a completely different way.

## Misc
- All Assembly Solution can be found inside the "AssemblySolutions" folder.
- Walkthrough for the game can be found inside the "GameWalkthrough" folder.
